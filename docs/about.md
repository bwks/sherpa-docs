# About

Sherpa is a tool that aims to make creating IT infrastructure labs intuitive and painless.

## Why?

I love the workflow of Vagrant. Define an environment in a config file and
build/destroy it with a few commands. This also made sharing labs with peers much easier.

Docker came along and it's great when you can get by with only using Containers.
I come from a networking background and in that space, VM's are mostly still king.
