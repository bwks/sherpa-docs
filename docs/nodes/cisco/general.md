The images are available via your account on the [Cisco Learning Store](https://learningnetworkstore.cisco.com/myaccount).
However, they come with the below warning which I have coped from [here](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/modeling-labs/vm-images-for-cml-labs/#vm-images-for-cml-labs). Use them outside of CML at your own risk.

!!! Warning

    The Cisco VM images that are provided for download with Cisco Modeling Labs or as part of the
    CML refplat ISO file are only licensed for use within Cisco Modeling Labs. Downloading these
    VM images and using them outside Cisco Modeling Labs without a proper license is prohibited.
